# Wikipedia-Airline-Names-Scraper
Scrapes all of the airlines in the world from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup and Python. <br>
There is not really much to explain about this. I had to scrape all the airlines names in the world for a school project. Thought this code might help other people. <br>
Check the comments in my code for explanations. <br>
You can use this code as you wish. <br>
